# Extract the domain name from a URL
### Problem
##### Write a function that when given a URL as a string, parses out just the domain name and returns it as a string.

### Examples:
```
domain_name("http://github.com/carbonfive/raygun") == "github" 
domain_name("http://www.zombie-bites.com") == "zombie-bites"
domain_name("https://www.cnet.com") == "cnet"
```
